--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproduce the behavior of the function strcmp (man strcmp).

Your function must be declared as follows:

int    ft_strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

The  strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into account (for a locale-aware comparison, see
       strcoll(3)).  The comparison is done using unsigned characters.

       strcmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

       •  0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

       •  a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

       •  a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.

       The strncmp() function is similar, except it compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than  zero  if  s1  (or  the  first  n  bytes
       thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
